## Feedback Request #1: Raw AIM Annualization
**Conv:** conv-20251227-223019
**Asked:** 2025-12-27
**Risk Level:** Medium
**Status:** Pending
**Context:** Designing Raw AIM metric for 8-part scoring system
**Question:** How should we handle annualization for the Raw AIM (Performance) metric?
**Options:**
1. Raw percentage (18% = score of 18) - Simple but doesn't reward time efficiency
2. Annualized (18% in 2 months = 108 annualized) - Rewards efficiency but breaks on day trades
3. Capped annualization (max 500%?) - Compromise
4. Tiered approach based on holding period
5. Log scale
**Blockers:** Can proceed with other metrics, this one needs resolution
**Workaround:** Using raw percentage for mockups
**Recommendation:** To be determined via Party Mode roundtable

**Conv:** conv-20251227-223019
**Asked:** 2025-12-27
**Risk Level:** Low
**Status:** Pending

2. Remove Alpha SHOT entirely
3. Redefine to measure something else
**Blockers:** None - can implement either way
**Workaround:** Using proposed formula for mockups
**Recommendation:** Discuss in Party Mode roundtable
