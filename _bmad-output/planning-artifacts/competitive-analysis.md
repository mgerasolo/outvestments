## Executive Summary

The investment tracking and social trading market is experiencing explosive growth across three distinct but converging segments:

1. **Prediction Markets** — Polymarket ($8B valuation) and Kalshi ($11B valuation) combined for ~$10B monthly volume in Nov 2025
2. **Congressional Trading Trackers** — Autopilot ($750M AUM), Unusual Whales, Quiver Quantitative with ETFs (NANC +73%, KRUZ +41% since 2023)
3. **Trading Journals & Copy Trading** — eToro (market leader), TraderSync, Tradervue, Edgewonk

**The Gap Outvestments Fills:** No platform combines thesis transparency, time-normalized scoring, benchmark comparison, AND gamification. Competitors either copy trades (no learning) OR track trades (no game feel).

## The Competitive Landscape

### Tier 1: Direct Threats (Same User Need)

| Competitor | What They Do | 2025 Metrics | Gap We Exploit |
|------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Autopilot** | Copy politician/celebrity trades | $750M AUM, $400M copying Pelosi alone | Zero learning, just copying. No skill development. |
| **eToro** | Social copy trading | Market leader, 100+ traders copyable | Copies trades, not reasoning. No thesis transparency. |
| **TraderSync** | AI-powered trading journal | $79.95/mo, 900+ broker integrations | Professional focus, not gamified, expensive |

### Tier 2: Adjacent Players (Different Mechanism, Similar User)

| Competitor | What They Do | 2025 Metrics | Gap We Exploit |
|------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Polymarket** | Event prediction markets | $2.76B monthly volume, 445K users, $8B valuation | Events, not stocks. No personal skill tracking. |
| **Kalshi** | Regulated prediction markets | $5.8B monthly volume, $11B valuation | Same as Polymarket — events, not portfolio performance |
| **Unusual Whales** | Congressional trade data + ETFs | NANC +73%, KRUZ +41% since launch | Data platform, not trading tool. No execution. |
| **Quiver Quantitative** | Alternative data for retail | 38.62% CAGR on Congress Buys Strategy | Research tool, not accountability system |

### Tier 3: Partial Overlap (Different Core Purpose)

| Competitor | What They Do | Gap We Exploit |
|------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Tradervue** | Basic trade journaling | No gamification, no thesis requirement, no NPC battles |
| **Edgewonk** | Statistical trade analysis | Professional traders only, complex, not fun |
| **Webull/Robinhood** | Brokerage with paper trading | No skill measurement, no thesis, no scoring |
| **thinkorswim paperMoney** | Professional paper trading | Complex, institutional focus, zero engagement features |

## Deep Dives: Key Competitors

### 1. Autopilot — "Trade Like Pelosi"

**The Platform You Were Thinking Of**

[Autopilot](https://www.joinautopilot.com/) lets users automatically mirror trades made by politicians, hedge fund managers, and celebrities.

**Key Stats:**
- $750 million AUM (Dec 2025)
- $400 million tied to copying Nancy Pelosi alone
- Also tracks: Michael Burry, Bill Ackman, Warren Buffett
- Pricing: Free for 1 portfolio, $100/year for unlimited

**How It Works:**
1. Connects to your existing brokerage (Robinhood, TD Ameritrade)
2. You pick a "pilot" (politician or investor)
3. When they disclose a trade, Autopilot executes the same trade for you
4. You allocate a percentage of your portfolio to each pilot

**Limitations:**
- 45-day disclosure delay (Stock Act requirement)
- Average delay is ~2 weeks, but can be longer
- No learning — you don't know WHY they made the trade
- Past performance doesn't predict future results

**What We Can Learn:**
- Massive demand for "follow the smart money" ($750M proves it)
- Simple UX matters — "pick and copy" is extremely accessible
- Transparency creates trust — disclosures are public, verifiable

**Where Outvestments Wins:**
| Autopilot | Outvestments |
|-----------|--------------|
| Follow someone else's thesis | Document YOUR thesis |
| No skill development | Proves/disproves YOUR skill |
| Just copying | Learning through accountability |
| Know WHAT they bought | Know WHY you bought |

---

### 2. eToro — Social Copy Trading Leader

[eToro](https://www.etoro.com/) pioneered social trading and remains the market leader.

**Key Features:**
- Copy up to 100 traders simultaneously
- Popular Investor Program (rewards being copied)
- Social feed like Twitter/Facebook for traders
- $100K virtual portfolio for practice
- Copy Stop-Loss (CSL) for risk management

**Mechanics:**
- Trades replicated proportionally (10% of their equity = 10% of yours)
- $200 minimum per trader copied
- No fee for copying (1% crypto fee only)

**What We Can Learn:**
- Social features create stickiness
- Popular Investor Program incentivizes quality
- News feed keeps users engaged daily
- Notifications (volatility alerts, trader updates) drive retention

**Where Outvestments Wins:**
| eToro | Outvestments |
|-------|--------------|
| Copy trades | Prove YOUR skill |
| See what someone did | See WHY you did it (thesis required) |
| Follow popular = follow success | Popular might = lucky |
| No time normalization | PPD makes comparison fair |

---

### 3. Polymarket & Kalshi — Prediction Markets

**The $20B Prediction Market Duopoly**

[Polymarket](https://polymarket.com/) and [Kalshi](https://kalshi.com/) are booming:
- Combined $10B monthly volume (Nov 2025)
- Polymarket: $8B valuation, crypto-native, global
- Kalshi: $11B valuation, CFTC-regulated, US-focused

**How They Work:**
- Binary outcomes: "Will X happen?" → Yes/No shares
- Price = probability (20 cents = 20% chance)
- If correct, share = $1. If wrong, share = $0.

**Why They're Hot:**
- 2024 election drove massive engagement
- Crypto traders looking for new markets
- Transparent, verifiable outcomes

**Adjacent Relevance:**
- Polymarket partnered with Stocktwits for earnings-based markets
- Kalshi integrated with Robinhood for sports betting

**What We Can Learn:**
- **Verifiable outcomes** build trust (blockchain receipts)
- **Game mechanics** (shares, odds, markets) are engaging
- **Time-bound predictions** create urgency and clarity
- **Community** forms around shared predictions

**Where Outvestments Wins:**
| Prediction Markets | Outvestments |
|--------------------|--------------|
| Events (politics, sports) | Stocks, options, portfolios |
| Binary (yes/no) | Nuanced (how much, how fast) |
| Single prediction | Target → Aim → Shot workflow |
| No thesis | Thesis required |
| Short-term focus | Long-term skill building |

---

| "Beat the Congress" leaderboard | Unusual Whales data | Compare user performance to congressional average |

## Conclusion

**Biggest Threat:** Autopilot — they've proven massive demand ($750M AUM) for "follow the smart money" with zero friction.

**Our Defense:** They help you copy. We help you BECOME the person worth copying.

**Market Reality:** The space is hot ($20B+ in prediction markets, $750M in copy trading) but fragmented. No one owns the intersection of:
- Thesis transparency
- Time-normalized scoring
- Gamified accountability
- Skill development

**Outvestments owns that intersection.** The question is execution speed and marketing positioning.
